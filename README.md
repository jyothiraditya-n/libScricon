## Pronunciation
Scricon is pronounced with the _scr-_ of _script_ and the _icon_ of... well... the word _icon_.

The spelling in the international phonetic alphabet is /skɹaɪkən/.

## Etymology

I wanted to make the name a portmanteau of the description. Alas, Sgricon does not a valid sequence of sounds in English make. However, the _graph-_ part of _graphical_ comes from a greek word which could mean 'write', so I replaced it with the _scr_ prefix from latin which is also related to writing, whence the _c_ in _scricon_.
